Our life is filled with distractions. Some distractions are exogenous, such as loud laughter of kids playing, flickering of TV, and smell of an enticing meal. Some are endogenous, such as the thought of a vacation on the beach or the urge to watch more TikTok videos. Imagine how effortful it is when we try to write an important paper before deadline while enduring with all these distractions! How are we able to FOCUS at all to achieve our goals?

Focus requires cognitive control, which is a set of important cognitive functions. Our lab investigates the neural bases of cognitive control. A long-term goal is to understand how cognitive control arises from neural processing at the psychological and physiological levels. We aim to understand how these processes produce flexible and generalizable goal-directed behaviors, and ultimately, how cognitive control can help us learn things and make decisions. We will leverage this knowledge to improve brain-computer interface and our ability to focus through neuromodulation. We tackle these questions using a combination of approaches: mathematical modeling, concurrent EEG/MEG recording, and intracranial electrophysiology in humans, to gain insights into the geometry of neural coding.
