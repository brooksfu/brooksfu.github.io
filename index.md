We investigate the computational and neural bases of cognitive control in learning, memory and decision-making. A long-term goal is to understand cognitive control arises from neural processing at the cognitive, system and neural circuit level to produce flexible and generalizable goal-directed behaviors. Our experimental approaches include intracranial microelectrode recordings, electrocorticography, electroencephalography and eye tracking. We develop various computational models to describe human behaviors in cognitive tasks and neural activity, and characterize the brain-behavior relationship.
