Psychiatric disorders adversely impact our ability to concentrate. Is it possible to enhance focus through targeted brain stimulation?

While current methods, such as deep brain stimulation employed for addressing the motor symptoms of Parkinsonâ€™s disease, have been promising, they sometimes carry unintended consequences, including deficits in cognitive control.

To mitigate these risks, our primary objective is a deeper comprehension of the network mechanisms underlying cognitive control. From this foundation, we aim to engineer neuromodulation techniques that stimulate specific brain regions with well-defined parameters, improving cognitive control. 

Our endeavors have the potential not only to reduce the adverse effects associated with existing brain stimulation methodologies but also to introduce innovative therapeutic strategies for addressing cognitive control impairments prevalent in psychiatric conditions.
