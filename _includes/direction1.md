Our ongoing research aims to delineate the sequential neuronal response profiles associated with cognitive control throughout this network. Our objective is to analyze functional connectivity, shedding light on the relationships between each node within the network. 

A notable observation is that lapses in focus often lead to errors. Monitoring our errors is a pivotal aspect of cognitive control. Our findings indicate that both the Error-Related Negativity (ERN) and error neuron spiking manifest initially in the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA), followed by the mid-cingulate cortex (MCC). Currently, we are investigating the potential functional connectivity between the pre-SMA and MCC during error processing.

To characterize human behavior, we employ Bayesian hierarchical models in cognitive tasks. Neuronal activity is then recorded at varying levels, and this activity is aligned with behavior through two methodologies: 

1. Classification of individual neurons based on behavioral parameters.
2. Behavior prediction from the collective activity of neuronal populations.

By mapping these parameters onto a high-dimensional space, we analyze their geometric relationship. Such approach elucidates the nuances of our error-monitoring mechanisms across diverse scenarios, offering insights into how we recalibrate focus towards our objectives.
