The human brain represents an intricate system, and despite advanced techniques, directly measuring the electrical activity across numerous neurons remains a formidable challenge due to the scarcity of human samples and data constraints. 

However, with the emergence of artificial neural networks (ANN), we now possess a platform to probe computational and algorithmic principles, offering insights into the operations of the human brain.
Our objective is to train ANNs to replicate human behaviors observed in cognitive tasks. By dissecting the architecture of these networks, we aim to discern how artificial neurons address and resolve specific tasks. 

The computational revelations from this endeavor could potentially illuminate the mechanisms employed by the human brain in analogous scenarios. Additionally, by introducing perturbations to the ANN, we intend to observe the resultant changes in network behavior. Such exploration presents an avenue to validate hypotheses concerning cognitive control deficits observed in psychiatric disorders, including OCD, ADHD, and schizophrenia.
