    <p><h4 id="postdoctoral-positions">Postdoctoral Positions</h4>
<p>Postdoctoral positions are available in the Fu Human Neuroscience Lab, UT Southwestern. We study the neural mechanisms of cognitive control using mathematical modeling and human neurophysiology. Applicants who are intellectually curious and passionate about tackling challenging neuroscience problems using a combination of approaches (behavioral modelling, intracranial recordings, neuromodulation, EEG/MEG) are encouraged to apply. Postdoctoral scientist in the lab will conduct cutting-edge research in a protected, interactive, highly collaborative, and well-funded environment, with access to state-of-the-art facilities such as EEG/MEG, intracranial recordings, high-performance computing sources. Ph.D. M.D. degree(s) are required. Applicants who are proficient in Python (MATLAB or R) and with a strong background in statistics, machine learning, deep learning and signal processing are particularly encouraged to apply.</p>

<h4 id="joint-postdoctoral-positions-with-pouratian-lab-utsw">Joint Postdoctoral Positions with Pouratian Lab, UTSW</h4>
<p>Postdoctoral positions are available in the Department of Neurological Surgery at UT Southwestern, jointly supervised by Nader Pouratian, M.D., Ph.D., and Zhongzheng Fu, Ph.D. We are seeking talented electrophysiologists and cognitive neuroscientists to join us to work on exciting projects in human neuroscience in the highly diverse and affordable city of Dallas, TX. The primary focus of this position is to help develop human single neuron recordings in intraoperative settings, using the latest recording technologies. The scientific goal is to develop an in-depth understanding of the network physiology underlying action regulation and cognitive control, and its dysfunction in movement disorders.</p>

<p>Required qualifications:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>1.Passion and curiosity for science and research topics
2.Ph.D. in Neuroscience or related fields
3.Hands-on experience in acquiring electrophysiological data
4.Familiarity with coding languages for data/signal processing and statistics.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Preferred qualifications:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>1.Expertise in setting up electrophysiological recording platforms
2.Expertise and track record in system neuroscience
3.Proficiency in state-of-the-art machine learning and bio-signal processing.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Postdoctoral scientists and Ph.D. students will conduct cutting-edge research in a protected, interactive, highly collaborative, and well-funded environment, with access to state-of-the-art facilities such as high-performance computing sources.  Apart from support and mentorship by both PIs, abundant career-development support and resources from the Department and the UTSW Oâ€™Donnell Brain Institute are available. The start date is in the <strong>fall/winter 2024</strong>, but flexible in exceptional circumstances. Funding for this position is available for 3 years and may be extended.</p>
