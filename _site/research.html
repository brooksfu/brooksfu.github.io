    <h5>Neural mechanisms of cognitive control</h5>
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <p><p>Cognitive control arises from the network activity across cortical and subcortical structures. An ongoing effort is to characterize the sequential neuronal response profiles related to cognitive control within the network. We aim to probe the functional connectivity to map the relationship between each network node. For example, when we fail to focus, errors occur. Monitoring our own errors is an important component of cognitive control. We have demonstrated that the ERN and error neuron spiking appear first in the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) and then in the mid-cingulate cortex (MCC). We now probe whether there is functional connectivity between pre-SMA and MCC during error processing. </p><p>We describe human behavior in well-designed cognitive tasks using Bayesian hierarchical models. We then record neuronal activity across different levels and align behaviors with neuronal activity in two ways: </p><li>Categorize single neuron by behavioral parameters. </li><li>Infer behavior by population activity of neurons. </li><p>We map these parameters into a high-dimension space and study the how they are geometrically connected. This helps us understand how our error monitoring mechanisms work across many different situations, and how we can refocus on our goals. </p></p>

    <h5>Cognitive control in silico</h5>
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <p><p>Our brain is a complex system. Despite our best efforts, directly measuring the electrical activity from large numbers of neurons in the human brain is extremely difficult because of limited human samples and data. With the advent of artificial neural networks (ANN), we can now test computational and algorithmic principles on such artificial networks, to understand how the human brain works.</p><p><li> We aim to train ANN to emulate human behaviors in cognitive tasks and analyze the structures of the network and understand how artificial neurons in the network solve the task. The computational insights we gain can inform us about how the real brain solve the same task. </li><li> We aim to perturb the ANN and understand how such it changes the network behavior. This would provide us with a venue to test hypotheses about cognitive control impairment in psychiatric illnesses, such as OCD, ADHD, and schizophrenia. </li></p></p>

    <h5>Neuromodulation</h5>
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <p><p>Many psychiatric illnesses impair our focus. Can we improve our focus by stimulating our brain? Current stimulation techniques, such as deep brain stimulation to treat motor symptoms of Parkinsonâ€™s disease, may lead to the side effect of cognitive control deficit. By understanding the network mechanisms of cognitive control better, we aim to develop sustainable neuromodulation methods to stimulate specific brain areas with well-defined parameters to improve cognitive control. Our efforts may not only reduce side effects of existing brain stimulation technique, but also to provide novel therapeutic approaches to treat cognitive control deficits in psychiatric illnesses. </p></p>
